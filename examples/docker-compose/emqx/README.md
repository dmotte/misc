# emqx

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then you can access your **MQTTX Web** (client) instance at http://localhost:8080/

> **Note**: the guys from EMQX also provide a publicly available client instance at https://mqttx.app/web-client. They also maintain desktop and CLI clients. See [mqttx.app](https://mqttx.app/) for more information

From there, you can connect to your **EMQX** (server) instance by creating a new connection to `ws://localhost:8083`

> **Note**: the guys from EMQX also provide a publicly available broker instance for testing. See https://broker.emqx.io/
