# syncthing

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is an open-source **continuous file synchronization** software.

It uses a **peer-to-peer network** for communication between the nodes. It also supports an [Untrusted Mode](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/untrusted.html) (i.e. **end-to-end data encryption**).

There is also the [Syncthing Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid) available.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then you can visit the **Web UIs** at https://localhost:8001/ and https://localhost:8002/.
