# win-export-drivers

In **Windows**, drivers are usually stored in the following directories:

- `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers`
- `C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore`
- `C:\Windows\System32\DRVSTORE` (if present)

You can copy them on a USB stick pendrive, then insert it into another PC and install the drivers there, by selecting the pendrive location when Windows asks for a directory to "find the drivers automatically".
