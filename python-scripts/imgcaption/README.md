# imgcaption

Simple Python script to generate **descriptive texts** (**captions**) for images, using the **[Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers)** library with the **`Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`** model. It is basically just a **wrapper** around such library.

## Usage

> **Important**: this has been tested with **Python 3.12.4** on **Windows 10**.

Set up a **Python venv** (virtual environment) and install some packages inside it:

```bash
python3 -mvenv venv
venv/bin/python3 -mpip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can use the script like this:

```bash
time printf '%s\n' *.jpg | venv/bin/python3 main.py
```
