# percampcut

**Perc**entile-based audio **amp**lifier and **cut**ter.

- Using the "**amplifier**" algorithm, you can **normalize** the audio track based on an **allowed clipping** percentage
- Using the "**cutter**" algorithm, you can **cut** the **start** and **end** of the audio track based on **minimum allowed signal levels**

## Usage

> **Important**: this has been tested with **Python 3.12.4** and **ffmpeg 4.3.1** on **Windows 10**.

Set up a **Python venv** (virtual environment) and install some packages inside it:

```bash
python3 -mvenv venv
venv/bin/python3 -mpip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then TODO:

```bash
venv/bin/python3 main.py TODO
```

TODO Bash script
